The Winter Wonderland update has dropped, which brings a whole host of new items, skins and fun things to do. Why not spruce up your base with a christmas tree? To provide the best Raptor Claus experience, we've increased the duration of night from 10 mins to 20 mins, so that means your daytime will only be 40 minutes.. kinda fitting for this time of year no?</>\n\n<RichColor Color=\"255,255,255,1\">Talking about full moons, we've also included is the Pure Form Mod as a tester.

Starter dinos are usually requested, so we have made a 'Starter Package' that is one-time claimable for new and old players alike.  There is still a lot of work to go on how we're best going to utilize the shop feature and how you get currency to spend in it, so it's pretty useless right now. One awesome feature though is that by selecting 'Trading Panel' you can see who is currently online!  The buffs/nerfs have been put into effect to balance taming - previously you could max level tame a dino with raw meat, no challenge in that.  Now if you want your max level dino, you're going to need Kibble.</>\n\n<RichColor Color=\"255,255,255,1\">NERFS</>\n<RichColor Color=\"255,255,255,1\">- Taming Speed: 8 down to 2</>\n<RichColor Color=\"255,255,255,1\">- Food Drain Multiplier: 4 down to 2</>\n<RichColor Color=\"255,255,255,1\">- Prime Meats & Mutton Stacks: 300 down to 25</>\n\n<RichColor Color=\"255,255,255,1\">BUFFS</>\n<RichColor Color=\"255,255,255,1\">- Honey:  1 up to 100</>\n<RichColor Color=\"255,255,255,1\">- Vaults: 1 up to 5</>\n<RichColor Color=\"255,255,255,1\">- Cannon Balls: 1 up to 5</>",
